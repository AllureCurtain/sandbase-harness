/**
 * Scheduled deployments, addressed at two prefixes.
 *
 * The published contract calls this resource a *deployment* and addresses it at
 * `/v1/deployments*`; this runtime has always called it a *scheduled deployment*
 * and served it at `/v1/scheduled-deployments*`. Both spellings are served.
 *
 * The routes are declared **relative to the mount** and `operations.ts` mounts
 * this one factory at `/scheduled-deployments` and at `/deployments`, so there is
 * one registration list and the two prefixes cannot drift route by route. A
 * curated per-route alias list is exactly the thing that drifts, leaving a route
 * that answers for one caller and 404s for another on the same resource.
 *
 * Two constraints shape this file, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. The paths must stay **literals**, and the aliasing must happen at
 *    `app.route()`. `tests/unit/support/route-table.ts` expands
 *    `app.<method>('<literal>'` and `app.route('<prefix>', factory)` statically
 *    from source text, so a path built from a base-path variable would make these
 *    routes invisible to the Console's API-reference guard and to
 *    `contract-honesty` while they kept working — a guard reporting green over a
 *    real divergence.
 * 2. This factory must live in its **own module** and be imported by
 *    `operations.ts`, because that parser only follows a mount whose factory is
 *    an imported identifier. Defining it in the same file as the mount would
 *    leave it unresolved and drop every deployment route from the table.
 *
 * `operations.ts` serves four resource families from one router mounted at `/v1`
 * and mirrored at `/v1/x`. That is why the deployments were **extracted** rather
 * than aliased in place: making that router's paths relative and remounting it
 * would have put `/webhooks` and `/outcomes` under `/v1/deployments/` as well.
 * Mounting this factory inside `operationsRoutes` (rather than in `server.ts`)
 * deliberately preserves the existing `/v1/x/scheduled-deployments` mirror, which
 * `tests/integration/operations-collection-envelope.test.ts` asserts, and gives
 * `/v1/x/deployments` the same legacy envelope as its canonical-prefix twin.

 * — the catch-up the contract forbids.
