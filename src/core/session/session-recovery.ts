/**
 * What the log records for a tool call that was dispatched but never returned.
 *
 * The runtime knows exactly one thing here: no `tool_result` was written. It does
 * **not** know whether the call took effect, and for a call that already wrote a
 * file, sent an HTTP request or ran a shell command, the effect may well have
 * happened. So the message states the uncertainty and stops.
 *
 * It carried `retry if needed` before, which is an instruction to do the one thing
 * that must not be done: repeat an external side effect on the strength of a
 * guess. A message that is *wrong about the world* is worse than a vague one — it
 * converts an unknown into a false negative, and the caller acts on it.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a failure either. The call is completed with
 * `is_error: true` so the message sequence stays paired and the turn can continue;
 * what must not be claimed is the outcome. A later change that retries a crashed
 * tool call, or that distinguishes pure from impure ones, is a decision this
 * message makes possible rather than one it makes.
