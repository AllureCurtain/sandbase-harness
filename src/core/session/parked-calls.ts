/**
 * The calls a session is waiting on, derived from its event log alone.
 *
 * This is one definition on purpose. It is read from two sides that must never
 * disagree: the `stop_reason` projection tells a client which ids to answer
 * (`event_ids`), and the executor's resume gate decides whether a turn may
 * start. If those two ever derive the parked set differently, a client is either
 * told to answer a call the gate does not know about, or a turn starts against a
 * tool-result sequence that is still missing a call — which providers reject
 * with "Tool result is missing for tool call <id>" and the session is terminated
 * for what was a documented, well-formed answer.
 *
 * Two families park a session, and the published contract parks them the same
 * way — the session pauses with `stop_reason.type: "requires_action"` and the
 * blocking events' ids in `stop_reason.event_ids`, and the client answers each
 * one:
 *
 * - an approval-gated `agent.tool_use` / `agent.mcp_tool_use` carrying
 *   `requires_confirmation`, answered by `user.tool_confirmation`;
 * - an `agent.custom_tool_use` the caller has not answered, answered by
 *   `user.custom_tool_result`. It carries no `requires_confirmation`: the
 *   runtime has no executor for a custom tool, which is why it is parked at all.
 *
 * A call is resolved when something in the log answers it, and each answer is
 * recorded under the `tool_use` **block** id — the built-in and MCP result
 * blocks, the deny result `ToolResolver` writes, and a custom result's
 * `metadata.custom_tool_use_id`. So resolution is tracked by block id while the
 * event id is what gets reported, and the two are carried side by side rather
 * than conflated: a call whose block id is resolved is excluded even though its
 * event id is what the array names.
