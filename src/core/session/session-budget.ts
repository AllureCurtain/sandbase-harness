/**
 * Session budget.
 *
 * A budget is an optional hard ceiling on what a session may spend, expressed
 * as a list cost. The published contract enforces it **between model requests**,
 * pauses rather than terminates when it is reached, and only accepts events that
 * settle work already in flight. This module owns the value object and every
 * rule that decides whether a budget may exist or change; the enforcement point
 * lives in the strategy loop and the manager.
 *
 * Two local decisions are recorded here rather than hidden:
 *
 * 1. Prices come from {@link CostProfile}, not from vendor pricing. A model the
 *    profile cannot price has "no list price", and a budgeted session naming
 *    such a model is refused — the published rejection path, reached for a local
 *    reason.
 * 2. Consumed cost is derived from the append-only event log on demand instead
 *    of from a running counter column. The log is the execution source of truth,
 *    and `span.model_request_end` is already the one canonical usage record per
 *    model request, so a second counter could only disagree with it.
