/**
 * Which tests assert each public error code is pinned (item 18, error taxonomy — coverage).
 *
 * The inventory (`error-code-inventory.test.ts`) says which codes exist and the attribution test says where
 * they are raised. Neither says whether anything **checks** them. Measured, that gap is real: of the 58
 * codes, **16 are mentioned by no test at all** (`store_full`, `invalid_json`, `already_exists`,
 * `invalid_path`, `instructions_too_long`, the `pi_rpc_*` family, `model_*`, `outcome_rubric_file_not_found`,
 * `pi_policy_mismatch`, `store_unavailable`, `too_many_stores`). This test pins which of them are covered so
 * the number cannot drift silently: adding a code forces a coverage decision, and a code losing its only
 * assertion shows up as a diff.
 *
 * **Model.** Coverage here means *literal presence* in the test tree — the code appears as `'<code>'` in a
 * `.ts` file under `tests/` — not execution. A mention inside a comment or a skipped case counts, and a test
 * that reaches the code through a variable does not. The model is deliberately cheap and stated rather than
 * implied, and the pinned lists name the exact files so anyone can check what "covered" is being claimed on.
